                Formed in 2012 in Harford County, Maryland, Deer Creek Sharp Shooters (DCSS) are six friends united by their shared passion for bluegrass and a vision to explore the boundaries of acoustic music. Since relocating to Steamboat Springs and Denver, Colorado in 2016, the band has truly hit its stride, blending traditional bluegrass roots with a playful, innovative spirit.

                Known for their high-energy performances and infectious camaraderie, DCSS creates a show experience that's as much about connection as it is about music. From blistering, fast-paced bluegrass jams to quirky, crowd-pleasing tunes about cats, their setlists are as dynamic as their personalities. Drawing inspiration from bluegrass legends and weaving in their own unique twist, DCSS offers a sound that's equal parts tradition and fresh creativity.
              </p>

In 2023, they released their debut album, Crik, a collection of original songs that showcase their musicianship, storytelling, and sense of fun.
